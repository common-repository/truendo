== Description ==

**What is TRUENDO?**

TRUENDO is an all-in-one GDPR website compliance solution. It is a consent management platform (CMP) with built-in, auto-generated, auto-updated privacy policy and cookie policy.
It is designed to allow users with any level of technical knowledge to get their website GDPR compliant hassle-free. Implementation is simply copy-paste. It also enables website visitors to easily make their privacy preferences and see all the information regarding their privacy settings, as well as the website policies in one place – the privacy widget, which they can always access via the bottom left corner of the website when enabled.

**How does it work?**

- TRUENDO scans your website and identifies cookies and the types of personal data the website collects. It then generates your privacy policy and cookie policy accordingly.

- TRUENDO automatically blocks all third-party cookies, scripts, pixels etc. before visitors give their consent. This helps to ensure that your website is GDPR complaint.

- After a visitor has made their privacy preferences, an anonymized unique visitor ID and associated consent record is created. This helps you manage any data subject requests (DSRs) from the given visitor.

- TRUENDO is built with the help of lawyers, data protection officers, and other experts in the field. It is designed to comply with data protection regulations such as the GDPR, ePrivacy and CCPA.


**What are some of the other features?**


- TRUENDO automatically scans your website once a month to ensure that you are always up-to-date and compliant.

- TRUENDO presents the data that it lawfully collects on a statistics dashboard, where you can learn about your website visitors and improve the way you target potential clients.

- You can customize the color scheme of your cookie banner and privacy widget to match your corporate identity, and display them in any of the supported 31 languages.

- You can invite colleagues and grant them user permissions to help manage your account.

- IAB TCF 2 certified.

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AAA-level conformity.

PLEASE NOTE: The plugin makes it easier for you to integrate TRUENDO into your website. You will need [a TRUENDO account](https://console.truendo.com/#/new-account/) to integrate the Privacy Center on your website. 

DISCLAIMER: TRUENDO is a Consent Management Platform with an integrated Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy. It is a website privacy solution for GDPR and CCPA compliance. However, there are many aspects of the GDPR that an organization needs to cover, website compliance is only one of these things. The implementation of a data protection law compliant Consent Management Platform (CMP) is ultimately at the discretion of the respective data protection officer (DPO) or legal department. To ensure your organization is fully compliant and up to date with the latest regulations, or to learn more about the other aspects to being GDPR compliant, such as creating a data inventory, conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA), or implementing a system to handle substantial amounts of Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR), we advise that you seek legal counsel.
